you should open/run main.py. For non-coders, basically lookup how python comments work if you don't know; uncomment relevant function and set variable; run. This scrapes to current directory cause I'm lazy so you should probably copy the src files to a folder. also run pip install bs4, pip install re, pip install json because we need those.


The point of this is to be simple and easy to edit so fellow programmers can add the features I'm too lazy to add, including:

epub conversion (I hate the epub format on windows so I dont' want to do this)

link traversal (following the "next chapter" link on each page to the end)

better support for novelupdates (you have to change books manually if there are multiple authors

figuring out random encoding problems (file's in utf-8, is volarenovels using utf-16 or something????)
